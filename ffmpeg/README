I slightly modified ffmpeg, so it will be able to decode xma. The header of xma is 4 bytes, but in wmapro it is a variable size.
So I have two solutions:
1. Make the header shorter (And shift all the bits accordingly)
2. Change wmapro decoder.
Right now I chose the second solution, because it is simpler.
The patch file with the change is in this folder.

If you want to compile it, follow the instructions at:
http://libav.org/platform.html#Microsoft-Visual-C_002b_002b-or-Intel-C_002b_002b-Compiler-for-Windows

Apply my patch, and configure libav with the following command line:
./configure --toolchain=msvc --disable-everything --enable-decoder=wmapro,mp3 --extra-cflags="-I ~/include" --enable-shared --disable-debug

Good luck!
